Project Name : JEWELER

Description: We're building an "all-in-one" app manger for Linux. This will include a utility program that recognises the format of the package the user is trying to install, and calls the right program that can install it. It includes an "app store" or "app hub" that collects available applications from various sources, like other app hubs or distribution libraries.
